# The app manifest YAML file tells Umbrel details about our app such as the name, description, dependencies, port number to access the app, etc.

# There are currently two manifest versions: 1 and 1.1. Version 1 is the basic version and is sufficient for most apps.
# However, if your app requires the use of hooks (scripts that are run at different stages of the app lifecycle), you need to use version 1.1.
# Hooks allow you to perform custom actions at different stages of the app's lifecycle, such as before the app starts (pre-start), after the
# app installs (post-install), and more. If your app doesn't need to use hooks, you can stick with manifest version 1.
manifestVersion: 1

# The ID should be unique within the app store and contain only alphabets (a-z) and dashes (-).
# It should be human readable and recognizable.
# The value "umbrel-app-store" and the id of your Community App Store are reserved and cannot be used.

# Disabled apps are not shown in the app store. This is useful for apps that are still in development. (optional)
#disabled: false

# This is the name of your App. It will show up in the App Store as well as on the home screen of Umbrel.
